# One_Keyword_Program_Language
A program language with only 1 keyword!

# SETUP. 

You need python. The version I used was python 3.13

# CODING.

Open code.onekey with a text editor of your choice. 

With onekey, you control a virtual keyboard that you interact with the 1 key. Typing anything expect 1 will be regraded as a comment.

every odd number line is treated as moving up in the virtual keyboard.

The virtual keyboard starts at 0, which is capslock. Capslocks changes to the second option in the list.

0 = [capslock capslock]
1 = [enter spacebar]
2 = [tab tab]
3 = [` ~]
4 = [z Z]
5 = [a A]
6 = [q Q]
7 = [1 !]
8 = [x X]
9 = [s S]
10 = [w W]
11 = [2 @]
12 = [c C]
13 = [d D]
14 = [e E]
15 = [3 #]
16 = [v V]
17 = [f F]
18 = [r R]
19 = [4 $]
20 = [b B]
21 = [g G]
22 = [t T]
23 = [5 %]
24 = [n N]
25 = [h H]
26 = [y Y]
27 = [6 ^]
28 = [m M]
29 = [j J]
30 = [u U]
31 = [7 &]
32 = [, <]
33 = [k K]
34 = [i I]
35 = [8 *]
36 = [. >]
37 = [l L]
38 = [o O]
39 = [9 (]
40 = [/ ?]
41 = [; :]
42 = [p P]
43 = [0 )]
44 = [' "]
45 = [[ {]
46 = [- _]
47 = [] }]
48 = [= +]
49 = [\ |]

every even number line is treated as inserting a key on the keyboard on your current location.
